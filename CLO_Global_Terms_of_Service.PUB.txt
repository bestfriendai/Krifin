9.3.1.4 Renewal License; Renewal License Charge ("RLC"). "Renewal License" means the non-perpetual, annually renewable right to Update the Licensed Materials, where such Updates are made available generally to other customers of CLO, for a specific period of time. "RLC" means fees payable for this right. Renewable Licenses are renewable on a yearly basis. The initial term of a license subject to an RLC begins on (i) the date of purchase or (ii) upon delivery of the Licensed Materials-whichever is later-or where such license is renewed, on the date of renewal. Where the Licensee fails to pay the applicable RLC, CLO will be under no obligation to provide Licensee with any of the updates, bug fixes, and additional support services that are made available to other customers of CLO who do pay the applicable RLC. CLO will invoice Licensee in respect of the RLC-provided that CLO will only provide such invoice if Licensee is then currently subject to a paid RLC.

9.3.1.5 Both the PLC and RLC Are Required for Initial Purchase. Primary Licenses cannot be sold separately and must be purchased with a Renewal License at Licensee's initial purchase of the Perpetual License. As such, both the PLC and RLC must be paid as a one-time license fee at the time of Licensee's initial purchase of a Perpetual License (and before first installation of the Licensed Materials). In addition, any subsequent Updates to any Licensed Materials acquired under a Perpetual License can be purchased on an annual basis, through the purchase of a Renewal License and the corresponding payment of the applicable RLC.

9.3.1.6 Subsequent RLCs Purchased at Licensee's Option. Any subsequent Renewal Licenses may be purchased with the payment of the applicable RLC (set forth in the License Schedule) on an annual basis. For each year in which an RLC is paid, Licensee would receive major and minor updates, bug fixes, maintenance and support.

9.3.1.7 RLC Accumulation Policy. If the RLC is not paid in any given year(s), Licensee must pay all RLCs since the last RLC was purchased in order to upgrade the Licensed Materials to the latest version.

9.3.1.8 Converting Perpetual Licenses to Annual Subscription Licenses.

9.3.1.8.1 Two-For-One Deal for the Initial Term. Licensee can elect to convert existing Perpetual Licenses to Annual Subscription Licenses under the following incentivized structure ("Conversion Option"). For each existing Perpetual License that Licensee elects to convert to an Annual Subscription License ("Converted License"), CLO will provide one (1) additional Annual Subscription License ("Promotional License"); and the Annual Subscription Fee for both the Converted License and the Promotional License will be waived for their Initial Term-provided that Licensee pays the RLC for the existing Perpetual License that Licensee is converting. In the subsequent year, for the Renewal Term of such Converted and Promotional Licenses, the Total Annual Subscription Fee that will be due and payable for such Converted and Promotional Licenses will be the number of such licenses multiplied by the Annual Subscription Price.

9.3.1.8.2 Option Expiration Date. The Conversion Option shall expire on June 30, 2022 ("Option Expiration Date").

9.3.1.8.3 Exercising the Conversion Option. At any time until the Option Expiration Date, Licensee may exercise the Conversion Option by so indicating in a Software Order executed by the Parties. Licensee may also exercise the Conversion Option contemporaneously with the execution of this Agreement by so indicating in this License Schedule

9.3.1.8.4 Miscellaneous Conditions. For Converted Licenses and Promotional Licenses:

9.3.1.8.4.1 The "Initial Term" will commence as of the latest to occur of (A) the date on which Licensee elects to exercise the Conversion Option ("License Conversion Date") or (B) upon delivery of the specific Licensed Materials and the new, specific User ID and Password necessary to access the Licensed Materials-and will continue for the period of twelve (12) months thereafter.

9.3.1.8.4.2 "Renewal Term" means, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Parties, the twelve (12) month renewal term automatically following either the Initial Term, or a previous Renewal Term.

9.3.1.8.4.3 Except for the Initial Term of such licenses, for which the Annual Subscription Fee will be waived in exchange for the payment of the applicable RLC, CLO's corresponding obligations to Licensee under this Agreement during the applicable Term are conditioned upon Licensee's payment of the applicable Annual Subscription Fee.

The "Initial Term' of any Annual Subscription Licenses will commence upon download or delivery of the specific Licensed Materials and will continue for a period of twelve (12) months thereafter. "Renewal Term" means, unless otherwise agreed in writing by CLO, the twelve (12) month renewal term following either the Initial Term, or a previous Renewal Term. The Initial Term and any subsequent Renewal Terms are individually and collectively referred to herein as the "License Term," "Subscription Term," "Annual Subscription," or "Annual Subscription Term".

9.3.3.2 Auto-Renewal for Individual Licenses. Annual Subscription Licenses that are provided under the License Class of Individual Licenses renew automatically, unless you cancel the subscription prior to the renewal date. You will be obligated to pay the corresponding Annual Subscription Fee for any and all Annual Subscription Licenses that are renewed. You will be billed annually for the Annual Subscription License each year until you cancel your subscription.

9.3.3.3 Other License Class Do Not Automatically Renew. Annual Subscription Licenses that are provided under any License Class other than Individual Licenses do not renew automatically. For any such non-auto-renewing Annual Subscription Licenses, although we may provide notice to you of an expiring subscription period, it is your responsibility to monitor the remaining term of your subscription period, and renew your subscription on a timely basis.

9.3.5 In some exceptional cases when agreed to in writing by CLO, CLO may provide you with a non-perpetual, non-automatically renewing subscription license (e.g. where it is necessary to prorate the Subscription Term of newly purchased Annual Subscription Licenses to match the then-active Subscription Term of previously purchased Annual Subscription Licenses for Enterprise or Academic customers). Although we may provide notice to you of an expiring subscription period, it is your responsibility to monitor the remaining term of your subscription period, and renew your subscription on a timely basis.

23.4 IF YOU ARE A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT, YOU WAIVE CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE §1542, WHICH SAYS: A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.

23.5 THE CLO PARTIES DO NOT ENDORSE AND ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACCURACY OR RELIABILITY OF ANY OPINION, ADVICE OR STATEMENT, NOR FOR ANY OFFENSIVE, DEFAMATORY, OBSCENE OR ILLEGAL POSTING OR CONDUCT, ON OUR SERVICES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, BY ANYONE OTHER THAN AUTHORIZED CLO EMPLOYEES WHILE ACTING IN THEIR OFFICIAL CAPACITIES.

24. INDEMNIFICATION
You agree to indemnify and hold CLO Parties harmless from any loss, liability, claim, or demand, including reasonable attorneys' fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of your use of the Services or Software in violation of these Terms and/or any breach of your representations and warranties set forth above and/or if content you Post causes us to be liable to another.

25. EQUITABLE REMEDIES
25.1 You acknowledge that the rights granted and obligations made under these Terms to CLO are of a unique and irreplaceable nature, the loss of which shall irreparably harm CLO and which cannot be replaced by monetary damages alone. Accordingly, CLO shall be entitled to injunctive or other equitable relief (without the obligations of posting any bond or surety or proof of damages) in the event of any breach or anticipatory breach by you.

25.2 You irrevocably waive all rights to seek injunctive or other equitable relief, or to enjoin or restrain the operation of the Services, exploitation of any advertising or other materials issued in connection therewith, or exploitation of the Services or any content or other material used or displayed through the Services and agree to limit your claims to monetary damages (but only to the extent permissible under these Terms)

26. GOVERNING LAW AND DISPUTES
26.1 You are contracting with CLO Virtual Fashion, LLC located at 16 E 34th Street, 18th Floor, New York, NY 10016 USA. The laws of the State of New York, USA govern the interpretation of these Terms and apply to claims for breach of these Terms, regardless of conflict of laws principles. The parties specifically exclude from application to these Terms the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act. All other claims, including claims regarding consumer protection laws, unfair competition laws, and in tort, will, only to the extent required by applicable law, be subject to the laws of your state of residence in the United States, or, if you live outside the United States, the laws of the country in which you reside. You and we irrevocably consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state or federal courts for New York County, New York, USA, for all disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms.

26.2 Without prejudice to any rights of CLO provided herein or otherwise, in the event of a dispute, the parties shall first exercise commercially reasonable efforts to resolve any such dispute amicably. If amicable resolution is unsuccessful, all claims you bring against CLO must be resolved in accordance with Section 26.3.

26.3 All claims you bring against CLO must be resolved in accordance with this Section 26.3. All claims filed or brought contrary to this Section shall be considered improperly filed. Should you file a claim contrary to this Section, CLO shall be entitled to recover attorneys' fees and costs up to $2,000, provided that CLO has notified you in writing of the improperly filed claim, and you have failed to promptly withdraw the claim.

26.3.1 Any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Services or the Software or these Terms must be filed within one year after such claim or cause or action arose regardless of any statutes or law to the contrary. In the event any such claim or cause of action is not filed within such one year period, such claim or cause of action are forever barred.

26.3.2 For any claim, (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) where the total amount of the award sought is less than $10,000, the parties shall resolve the dispute in a cost effective manner through binding non-appearance-based arbitration. The party requesting relief shall initiate such arbitration through an established alternative dispute resolution ("ADR") provider mutually agreed upon by the parties. The ADR provider and the parties must comply with the following rules: (a) the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions, and the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration; (b) all aspects of the arbitration shall be conducted in the English language; (c) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties; and (d) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator shall be final and may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

27. Publicity
You grant CLO the right to use your company name and logo as a reference for marketing or promotional purposes on our website and in other public or private communications with our existing or potential customers, subject to your standard trademark usage guidelines as provided to us from time to time. CLO doesn't want to list users who don't want to be listed, so you may send us an email to legal@clo3d.com stating that it does not wish to be used as a reference and a reasonable period to stop the use.

28. SEVERABILITY
The provisions of these Terms are intended to be severable. If for any reason any provision of these Terms shall be held invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part in any jurisdiction, such provision shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without in any manner affecting the validity or enforceability thereof in any other jurisdiction or the remaining provisions hereof in any jurisdiction.

29. ENFORCEABILITY, ENTIRE AGREEMENT & NON-WAIVER
These Terms are deemed accepted upon any use of the Services. These Terms and any additional terms referenced herein constitute the entire agreement between you and CLO regarding the use of the Services and Software (subject to any separate EULA). Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.

30. ASSIGNMENT
You may not transfer or assign any of the rights or licenses granted to you hereunder without our prior written consent therefor. However, we may transfer or assign all or a part of our rights or responsibilities under these Terms to any person or entity without your consent.

31. FORCE MAJEURE
We are not liable for any changes or problems out of our control, for example changes or problems caused by like natural disasters, war, terrorism, riots, embargoes, acts of civil or military authorities, fire, floods, accidents, network infrastructure failures, strikes, or shortages of transportation facilities, fuel, energy, labor or materials.

32. TECHNICAL AND CUSTOMER SUPPORT
